#  HUD 
---
##### Group Project *Christian Ericksen, Charlie Drews, William Tygret, Kyle McNee (powered by Touchlab)*

###  WHAT IT DOES:
HUD (short for heads-up-display), is a personal assistant app that keeps track of top news stories, Facebook posts, reminders, and other pertinent info in an interface that is fast, clean, and intuitive.  We like to say that HUD provides you with what's important, when it's important.  Unlike other personal assistant apps, HUD does not rely on collecting your search history to deliver relevant cards to you.  Any info you provide to it is done so voluntary.  When it comes to personal data, we favor an opt-in approach to an opt-out one.
* Data syncs automatically every minute while app open, and manually after user does the refresh gesture (swipe down)
* Cards are animated - they fly in from the bottom of the screen - on each recycler view refresh
* Web data saved to database for offline access
* NYTimes headlines/thumbnails link out to the article in the browser
* User can log into facebook (if user is Kyle; other users have to wait until facebook approves our app)
* Reminders are saved in database when added
* If alarm date/time set for reminder, a notification w/ alert sound launches at that time
* MTA card shows MTA's status widget, which is interactive

# W+
---
### WHAT IT DOES:
This was my chance to play around and do whatever I wanted. I love to play with animations and interact with my users, so the W+ app was more of a way for me to take my previous experience of Graphic Design to the next level with motion and animations.
A spin on a personal website turned into a personal app, equipt with:
*Resume tab with function to send Resume directly to email 
*A Contact tab with function to Direct Email Feature to Williamâ€™s Personal Email
*A social media tab that automatically Syncs to William's Instagram using Instagram's API and the RetroFit Library 
*A Projects Tab with a Gallery of Professional Projects: includes screenshot and description
*A Gallery Tab of Personal Art Projects
*A Tab dedicated to creative exploration, includes Stone Code Steve Austin mode
